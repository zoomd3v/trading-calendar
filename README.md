Trading Calendar is a minimalist web-based application designed for traders who want to keep track of their trading performance. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this application offers a clean, intuitive interface for recording and visualizing your trading journey without any installation required.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar Interface**: Navigate between months and view your trading performance at a glance
- **Daily Trading Records**: Log profit/loss amounts and number of trades for each day
- **Weekly Summaries**: Automatically calculates and displays weekly performance totals
- **Monthly Performance Tracking**: See your monthly profit/loss totals to track longer-term performance
- **Data Persistence**: Save your trading data locally using browser storage
- **Export/Import Functionality**: Export your data as CSV or save to a local file for backup
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for those long trading sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

The Trading Calendar uses a simple, intuitive interface:

1. Navigate through months using the arrow buttons
2. Click on any day to add or edit trading data
3. Enter profit/loss amount and number of trades
4. View weekly and monthly summaries automatically calculated
5. Export or import data for backup or analysis in other tools

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and content
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality and data management
- **LocalStorage API**: For saving data between sessions

## Usage

### Adding Trading Data

1. Click on any day in the calendar
2. Enter your profit/loss amount (use negative numbers for losses)
3. Enter the number of trades executed that day
4. Click "Save Data"

### Navigating the Calendar

- Use the left and right arrows to move between months
- Click "Today" to quickly return to the current month
- The monthly profit/loss total is displayed at the top

### Data Management

- **Save to File**: Save your trading data to a local file
- **Load from File**: Load previously saved trading data
- **Export Data**: Export your data as CSV for use in spreadsheet applications
- **Import Data**: Import data from CSV files

## Future Enhancements

I'm planning to add several features in the future:

- Statistical analysis of trading performance
- Visual charts and graphs for better data visualization
- Trading strategy tags to track performance by strategy
- Light/dark theme toggle
- Cloud synchronization

## Why I Built This

As a trader, I needed a simple yet effective way to track my daily performance. Most existing solutions were either too complex or lacked the specific features I needed. This calendar provides a visual representation of trading activity that helps identify patterns and trends in my trading behavior.

The calendar format makes it easy to:
- Spot winning and losing streaks
- Identify which days of the week perform best
- Track progress toward monthly goals
- Maintain consistency in recording trading activities
